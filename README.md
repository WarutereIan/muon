#Project Muon 

has similar functionality to the Pi network:
users get rewarded for logging in within the last 24h
the mining rate also increases based on the number of users they bring on board

launched on the ethereum blockchain via infura provider

will be modified to run on own blockchain with own consensus protocol later:
therefore seperate blockchain will be developed

for now can be run on a local fork
